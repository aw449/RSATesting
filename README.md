# RSATesting - Java Branch
Testing how good RSA keys generated by different libraries in different languages are, a part of 14:332:424/519 Information and Network Security class at Rutgers

# How to use this Repository:
Each language gets their own branch, and to see the progress of another group, switch branches \
Try not to modify files created by other groups? (for pushing purposes)

# Quick 30 Seconds on Git
git clone <insert link>       (copies repository) \
git add (-A)                  (adds changes made) \
git commit (-m "message) (-a) (commits changes made) \
git push                      (pushes commits to the server on github) \
git pull                      (pulls new commits made by other people) \
git checkout <branch name>    (switches branches to branch name) \
